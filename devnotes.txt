flashcarts that can be directly built:

- All DSTT-based clones
- All R4iTT 3DS based clones
- GBA Movie Player (Compact Flash) (NDS MP flashed)
- iSmart Premium
- EZ-Flash V (SDHC is not tested. Some outdated sources suggest that EZV SDHC does not have SD card init, and thus cannot be booted from DLDI alone.)

flashcarts that have some protection built in
- Original R4
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x484a
- Ace3DS+
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld to build (default one used in most DS projects)
- R4 i.L.S., all r4isdhc.com.cn carts, r4isdhc.hk carts dated 2020 or newer
    - build with ndstool with args `-g "####" "##" "R4XX"`
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld to build (default one used in most DS projects)
- Gateway Blue (possibly R4infinity 2?)
    - build with ndstool with args `-g "####" "##" "R4IT"`
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld to build (default one used in most DS projects)
- R4i-SDHC, r4isdhc.com 2014+ carts
    - has a hash checking watermark at every 0x200 bytes
    - problem is fincs's code is broken and doesn't seem to compile on any devkitARM version
        - so for now just have R4.dat from alternate_loaders and 'cp TTMenu.dat _boot_ds.nds`

flashcarts with a particular load address:
- all r4ids.cn carts, R4 Ultra and R4i Ultra
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000800
    - For some reason if you try to change this by setting CRT0 address in LDFLAGS this doesn't work. So a specs file is provided.
    - R4i Ultra can just be converted to an Acekard 2i. One should do that instead and get the benefits of a true Acekard 2i instead.
- Acekard 2, 2.1, 2i
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000450
- Wood r4igold.cc upgrade
    - Appears to be related to the Galaxy Eagle line?
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000000
- R4iDSN
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000000

flashcarts that require extra files
- M3 DS Real, R4RTS, iTouchDS, iTouch2, R4 SDHC RTS black
    - Any of these will launch /_system_/_sys_data/r4i.sys which is just a normal NDS file
    - all boot files are derived from the R4RTS loader, with different encryption keys
    - All thanks goes to Taiju Yamada, Rudolph and NDS Laboratory for tools and/or tips on getting this correct
    - R4RTS:
        - launches 'loader.eng', which launches /_system_/_sys_data/r4i.sys
    - R4 SDHC RTS black
        - launches /_DS_MENU.sys.
        - otherwise identical to R4RTS. No effort was put in here. Thanks r4isdhc.com team
    - M3 DS Real:
        - checks /SYSTEM/g6dsload.1, and launches /SYSTEM/g6dsloader.eng. 
        - g6dsload.1 is a very specific stub for now, not sure what its use is but it needs to be there, so for now I just used whatever the converter spewed out
    - iTouchDS, iTouch2
        - launches `boot.*` depending on region of cart. No easy way to identify, but they are all different encryption keys.
        - just check which one it is manually, it's 3 files anyway
- SuperCard DSONE SDHC / SuperCard DSOnei
    - For some reason if you try to directly create the DSONE SDHC bootloader you don't get access to entire hardware. This breaks YSMenu.
        - Thus some extra binaries are included
        - All thanks goes to Bliss for the initial bootloader files
        - MSFORSC.nds is for the older SuperCard DSONE SDHC models
        - SCFW.SC is presumably the newer one.
        - Both files are exactly the same and behave exactly the same. But for sanity check just have both.
        - This is meant to be a triple loader, but I don't actually remember which files it boots other than TTMenu.dat. 
            - We are going to use TTMenu.dat for simplicity's sake. 
            - The exact same DLDI as any DSTT is used. And it works, so who cares XD
        - Not compatible with the original DSOne. This will require another DLDI.

random notes:
- MSHL2 writes 32KB of data, regardless of what your DLDI size is. This breaks a bunch of homebrew. You need to recompile libnds with 32KB DLDI size to fix.
